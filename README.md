# DataViliJ
Data Visualization Library in Java 
-A desktop application that allows users to select an algorithm (from a set of standard AI algorithms) and dynamically shows the user what changes and how.

This was the first project I created alongside using Git. 
As you can see there are many scattered directories lodged in this project, sorry about that.
The completed project is placed within the 'homework4' folder.

This project was created solely by me with the use of the template that my professor had given.
