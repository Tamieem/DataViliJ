# DataViliJ
Data Visualization Library in Java created as project for class

This was the first project created while using Git. 
As you can see there are many scattered directories lodged in this project, sorry about that.
The completed project is placed within the 'homework4' folder.

This project was created solely by me with the use of the template that my professor had given.
